# neural-networks-and-deep-learning

This repository contains my notes of Michael Nielsen's[Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com),and also includes my answers to the exercises in this book.This famous book consists of six chapters:

* Using nerual nets to recognize handwritten digits
* How the backpropagation algorithm works
* Improving the way nerual networks learn
* A visual proof that neural nets can compute any function
* Why are deep neural networks hard to train
* Deep learning
