# neural-networks-and-deep-learning

This repository contains my notes of Michael Nielsen's  [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com), and my answers to the exercises in this book. This famous book consists of six chapters:

* 01-Using nerual nets to recognize handwritten digits
* 02-How the backpropagation algorithm works
* 03-Improving the way nerual networks learn
* 04-A visual proof that neural nets can compute any function
* 05-Why are deep neural networks hard to train
* 06-Deep learning
